Welcome, wanderer of the world wide web of wonders! Pray, click hither to the illustrious "Magical Supplies" and rejoice! For thou hast stumbled upon an emporium which makes Aladdin's cave look like a disorganized jumble sale.

Herein lies a trove where the miraculous meets the marketable, and the prudent purchaser can barter for baubles and trinkets teeming with an arcane allure that's truly, erm, hard to quantify. Founded by the incomparable and entirely reputable Cornelius Cobblepot, our establishment thrives on providing the mystical masses with what might be considered "deals".
While not every artifact comes with a guarantee of effectiveness or safety, each certainly boasts an undeniable charisma, not unlike our own dear Mr. Cobblepot, who insists that "satisfaction" is a term relative to perspective and expectations best left... flexible.

Our return policy is a testament to the confidence we hold in our products, a timeless covenant enshrined in tradition; once a magical marvel passes into your possession, it becomes a chapter of your destiny, irrevocably entwined with no need for monetary refunds.
We, the humble purveyors at Magical Supplies, must declare, with all due respect to the venerable laws of wizardry and man, that any unforeseen consequences, be they sudden stubbornness, unexpected growth of fur, or an irrevocable appreciation for the greener grass yonder, fall solely within the realm of the purchaser's responsibility.
